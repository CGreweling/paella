			<h1>Paella Player usage and features guide</h1>
			
			<h2>1   Basic usage</h2>
			
			<p>Paella is designed to display two video windows, with the camera and the presentation view, and some information
			regarding the lecture. You can navigate through the slides and tabs, but you can also begin viewing the lecture 
			by pressing the play button on top of the video window or in the control bar.</p>
			
			<p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/capture_player.jpg" class="alignCenter"></p>
			
			<ol><li><p>Paella display areas</p><p>There are three main areas in Paella:</p><p>The video display, where you can see the video of the lecture hall and the video of the presentation device 
			and the player control buttons. The bottom pane, where you will find useful information of this lecture
			The right pane, where you will find information related to this lecture, like other lectures for this series
			or lecture suggestions.</p><p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/capture_extended.jpg" class="alignCenter"></p><p>You can change the arrangement of those areas using the resize tool. You will find four sizes, from the 
			smallest video window to the fullscreen video area.</p><p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/toolbar_pagelayout.png" class="alignCenter"></p><p>Be noticed you can also drag the player window to any extent; Paella will fill the browser window accordingly.</p></li><li><p>Subtitles</p><p>Paella can display subtitles from a Matterhorn server. As today, if there are multiple subtitles for a 
			lecture, Paella will only display the first one.</p><p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/toolbar_captions.png" class="alignCenter"></p></li></ol>
			
			<h2>2	Managing views</h2>
			
			<p>The view button selects which arrangement between the lecture video and the presentation video is displayed, 
			so you can focus on the most interesting points.</p>
			
			<p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/toolbar_videolayout.png" class="alignCenter"></p>
			
			<p>These views are configurable by the administrator of your site.</p>
			
			<h2>3	Locating content</h2>
			
			<p>In most cases you don’t want to see the whole lecture, but going to some interesting part of it. Paella provides
			several tools to navigate through the lecture and locate those interesting points.</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li><p>The progress bar</p>
					<p>The progress bar shows the current playing time. You can click over it to jump to any point in the lecture.</p>
					<p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/toolbar_playbar.png" class="alignCenter"></p>
				</li>
				
				<li><p>The slide navigation tool</p>
					<p>Clicking on the last button you can open the slide navigation tool. There you can move your mouse over the slides and a 
						high resolution slide will be shown over the presentation video.</p>
					<p>Click on any slide to go to that point.</p>
					<p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/toolbar_slides.png" class="alignCenter"></p>
				</li>
				<li><p>The view again tool</p>
					<p>The view again plugin goes back 30 seconds into the past, to review any difficult point on the lecture.</p>
					<p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/toolbar_rewind30.png" class="alignCenter"></p>
				</li>
			
			
				<li><p>The comments plugin*</p>
					<p>Using the comments tool you can tell whatever you want about the lecture. Comments are public and 
						anybody can view them</p>
					<p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/extendedtab_comments.png" class="alignCenter"></p>
				</li>
				<li><p>The footprints plugin</p>
					<p>Clicking on the footprints button you can see a “heat map” on the views of the lecture, showing the most
						and least viewed parts of it. Click on the progress bar to go there if you are interested.</p>
					<p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/toolbar_footprints.png" class="alignCenter"></p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h2>4	Sharing content</h2>
			
			<ol><li><p>The social network plugin</p><p>The social network plugin allows publishing a link for this lecture in Facebook, Twitter or embed in your own page. Please take
			into account that the access policy of your server may not allow it. </p><p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/toolbar_social.png" class="alignCenter"></p></li></ol>
			
<!--			
			<h2>5	Editing lectures</h2>
			
			<p>Paella allows teachers and video owners to edit a lecture.
			A requisite to do that is to have a Matterhorn 1.4 server or newer with the public annotations service.</p>
			
			<ol><li><p>The edit button</p><p>If you have enough rights to edit a video (usually because you are the teacher of the lecture), then you will
			notice a pen icon on the top left of the video window. Clicking on that pen you will go to the editing mode.
			<img alt="Image" title="" src="images/button_editor.png" class="alignCenter"> </p><p>When you enter the edit mode you will notice a timeline on the lower part of the screen. There you will 
			find the editing tools (currently Trimming, Breaks and Subtitles) on the left and a save button on the right.</p><p><img alt="Image" title="" src="images/capture_editor.jpg" class="alignCenter"></p><p>Editing is done always in full/embedded mode. It is advised to maximize your web window for clear viewing.</p></li><li><p>Soft editing and hard editing</p><p>Paella works in Soft edit mode. So, when you make any editing on a lecture you are not changing the real
			lecture, you are writing some special marks on the lecture and Paella will recognize those marks and change
			the behavior of the playing session. If you want to undo the editings you can do that, but on the other hand,
			if the content could be accessed by other means than Paella, users could access to the unedited lecture.</p><p>This is quite different than the hard editing approach, in which the changes are applied to the lecture are
			permanent and forever.</p></li><li><p>Setting the beginning and the end of a lecture (Trimming tool)</p><p>Using the trimming tool you can decide the beginning and the end of lecture. Select the tool and slide left
			and right to the desired time. Zoom button, on the bottom left, can be useful for finding the end of a lecture.</p><p>After setting that, press save to apply the changes. From now on, Paella will recognize the settings and jump
			to that point when playing.</p></li><li><p>Setting breaks in a lecture</p><p>Using the breaks tool you can set intervals in which the lecture is not useful. When paella arrives to the
			beginning of a break, it will automatically jump to the end of that break. You can set several breaks in a lecture.</p><p>Remember to save changes after doing that with the save button.</p></li><li><p>Editing subtitles</p><p>Using the subtitles tool you can modify the subtitles for a lecture. Select the desired subtitle and you can
			modify it on the left pane.</p><p>This tool is currently under development.</p><p>*Requires a Matterhorn lecture  with uploaded subtitles </p></li><li><p>The publishing plugin</p><p>This plugin sets a flag that indicates a Sakai CMS server that the owner of a lecture allows publishing.
			If you don’t have that environment you probably won’t use it.</p></li></ol>
